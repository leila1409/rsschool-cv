## Code Examples:
### Description
Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases

```
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if( exam > 90 || projects > 10){
    return 100
  } else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5){
    return 90
  } else if (exam > 50 && projects >= 2){
    return 75
  } else {
    return 0
  }
}
```
